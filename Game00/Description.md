There is a game where you need to fire a projectile from tank to hit the targets(right now only helicopters).

The tank is at the bottom of the screen and helicopters are above him flying from right to left and from left to right.

In the game you control the trajectory of your tank's barrel and the angle of the shot. The projectile has it's own physics and gravity.

Your goal in the game is to protect the tank from aproaches enemies.

The helicpoters are not danjerous while they are not above the tank. When they get above the tank they drop a bomb, which also has its own gravity and physics.

The tank has 3 lives. If an enemy's projectile hits the tank it looses one life. If the tank runs out of lifes the game is over.
